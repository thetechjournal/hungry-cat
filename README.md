## How did I do it?

### Creation of Animated Fish GIFs

- Learned about Sprite Sheets from [Franks Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/c/Frankslaboratory)
- Used free Fish sprite sheets from [Game Developer Studio](https://www.gamedeveloperstudio.com/)
- Coverted the sprite sheet into animated fish using [sprite sheet to gif converter from Online PNG Tools](https://onlinegiftools.com/convert-sprite-sheet-to-gif)

### Fish Swimming:

- Used CSS3 Animation for indefinite fish animation
- Used GSAP for curved animation.

### Features:
- The cat color turns to red after 5 seconds as she gets hungry.
- A random number is generated between 2-8 and displayed as 'How many fishes cat want?'
- Once the first fish is catched, the cat jumps and a meow sound is played. The cat asks for more fishes.
- When more fishes are fed to the cat, a burp sound is played & cat jumps with joy. It asks for more until fish number matches the number of fishes the cat wants.
- Once the cat gets all what she wants, it goes for a sound sleep.
